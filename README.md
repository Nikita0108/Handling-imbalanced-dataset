# Handling-imbalanced-dataset
## What are imbalanced dataset?
Classification problems having huge class imbalance in their target i.e. the number of 1 class is way more than the number of the other(e.g. ratio: 1:1000). 
## What steps to take?
In the notebook I have used different special algorithms to tackle these kind of problems.(using a library known as imblearn)
